# Secret Manager HSM in ARM Assembly

## Objective:
Develop a secret manager HSM capable of storing sensitive information such as passwords, IDs, encryption keys, and identity card data. The project will primarily be developed in ARM assembly, with fallback to C when necessary.

## Hardware:
- STM32L452RE-P (Nucleo)
- ST25R3916 (NFC Controller)
- EEPROM (Component yet to be determined)
- Other security components (to be added)

## Development Environment:
- **Toolchain**: `arm-none-eabi`
- **Debugging**: `OpenOCD`, `GDB`

## Debug/Programming Procedure:
1. Connect the Nucleo board and set up the necessary environment.
2. Flash and debug the firmware:
    ```bash
    $ openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32l4x.cfg
    $ arm-none-eabi-gdb firmware.elf
    (gdb) layout regs
    (gdb) ni
    ```

## Step-by-step Breakdown Plan:

### Step 1: Basic MCU Familiarization (Blinky Project)
#### Goal:
Get comfortable with programming the Nucleo-L452RE-P in ARM assembly.

#### Tasks:
1. **Learn ARM Assembly Syntax**:
   - Familiarize yourself with basic instructions (`MOV`, `LDR`, `STR`, `ADD`, `SUB`) and control structures (`B`, `BL`, `CMP`, `BEQ`).
   - Study the ARM Cortex-M architecture, focusing on registers, stack usage, and memory access.

2. **Set Up Development Environment**:
   - Install toolchains (like `arm-none-eabi-gcc` and `arm-none-eabi-as`) and configure your build environment for assembly programming.
   - Flash programs onto your Nucleo board using a debugger (e.g., GDB or OpenOCD).

3. **Develop Blinky**:
   - Write ARM assembly code to control an LED on the Nucleo board.
   - Configure GPIO registers in assembly to blink the LED.

#### Learning Outcome:
Gain understanding of GPIO control and ARM assembly basics, setting a foundation for more complex hardware interactions.

### Step 2: Establish a UART Serial Connection
#### Goal:
Implement a serial communication interface between the Nucleo-L452RE-P and your PC for debugging and data exchange.

#### Tasks:
1. **Understand UART Communication**:
   - Learn UART protocol basics: baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity.
   - Study UART registers on the STM32L452RE and how to configure them.

2. **Write UART Driver in Assembly**:
   - Configure UART peripheral registers and set up an interrupt or polling mechanism for sending/receiving data.
   - Test serial communication with a terminal emulator (`minicom`, `screen`).

#### Learning Outcome:
Gain familiarity with serial communication, register-level programming, and interrupt handling.

### Step 3: Interface with Security EEPROM
#### Goal:
Establish communication with a security EEPROM (e.g., Microchip ATECC608A or STMicroelectronics M24LR64-R) using I2C.

#### Tasks:
1. **Learn I2C Protocol**:
   - Study I2C (start/stop conditions, addressing, read/write operations).
   - Learn how to configure I2C peripherals on the STM32L452RE.

2. **Develop I2C Driver in Assembly**:
   - Write assembly code to initialize and communicate with an I2C device (EEPROM).
   - Implement read/write operations to/from the EEPROM.

#### Learning Outcome:
Learn I2C communication, register-level hardware configuration, and EEPROM interaction.

### Step 4: Interface with NFC Controller (ST25R3916)
#### Goal:
Establish communication with the ST25R3916 NFC controller to perform basic read/write operations.

#### Tasks:
1. **Understand NFC Communication**:
   - Study NFC protocols (ISO14443, ISO15693) and the ST25R3916 functionality.
   - Learn how to communicate with the NFC controller via SPI or I2C.

2. **Develop SPI/I2C Driver for NFC**:
   - Write ARM assembly code to initialize and communicate with the NFC controller.

3. **Perform NFC Operations**:
   - Implement basic NFC read/write commands for tags or data transmission.

#### Learning Outcome:
Understand NFC protocols, develop SPI/I2C communication, and handle complex peripherals.

### Step 5: Secure Data Storage and Key Management
#### Goal:
Implement secure data storage and key management functions for the HSM.

#### Tasks:
1. **Memory Management and Data Structures**:
   - Implement data structures in assembly for storing secrets (passwords, keys, etc.).

2. **Encryption and Decryption**:
   - Learn symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms (AES, RSA).
   - Implement encryption/decryption using hardware cryptography from EEPROM or in assembly.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Implement password-protected access to stored data, ensuring only authorized users can retrieve secrets.

#### Learning Outcome:
Securely store and retrieve data, implement encryption, and understand key management.

---

### Step 6: Full Identity Management with NFC and Security Features
#### Goal:
Integrate NFC to manage identities and secure communication within the HSM.

#### Tasks:
1. **Store and Retrieve Identity Information**:
   - Interface EEPROM and NFC to store/retrieve identity cards, passwords, or encryption keys.

2. **Implement Security Protocols**:
   - Use encryption, authentication, and NFC capabilities to secure data transmission.

3. **Optimize Assembly Code**:
   - Optimize your assembly code for size and speed, optionally using C for complex logic.

#### Learning Outcome:
Achieve a full HSM with identity management and secure NFC communication.
